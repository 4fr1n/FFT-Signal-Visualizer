# FFT-Signal-Visualizer
Signal processing and visualization tool for time-domain and frequency-domain analysis.   Generates or captures input signals, computes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using optimized NumPy operations, and plots waveform + frequency spectrum. Includes dominant frequency detection and optional noise-threshold alerts, built with Python and Matplotlib.
